            Based off a project prompt, this WordPress inspired application
            allows signed-in users to create and manage 'Pages' and 'Posts'. Any
            non-signed in user can view all blog posts by all the users within
            the community! This project was a collaborative effort with 2 other
            fellow GA students, using Git and GitHub for version control and,
            project management. This single application was built using
            <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, <span>Jquery</span> and
            Handlebars for the front-end. Our non-relational database uses
            <span>MongoDB</span>, as well as <span>ExpressJS</span> for an API
            with <span>Node.js</span> and <span>Mongoose</span>.
